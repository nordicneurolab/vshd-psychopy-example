Usage examples for PsychoPy using NordicNeuroLab VisualSystem HD.

As of june 2022, the 3D example will not run on the newest versions of PsychoPy.
This is caused by a problem in the PsychoPy visuals class. 
The problem should be solved within the next release.
Please use version 2019.1.0 if you want to run the 3D script.
